For other uses, see Allied Shinobi Forces Technique (disambiguation).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe Allied Shinobi Forces Technique is a combination of many techniques devised by Shikaku Nara, using the unique abilities of the Allied Shinobi Forces to combat the Ten-Tails.\\\\n\\\\nUsage[]\\\\nThe Allied Shinobi Forces Technique is focused on three primary goals; disrupt the opponents sensory abilities, restrain the Ten-Tails, and combat and remove Madara and Obito Uchiha from play. Using Inoichi\\'s telepathic abilities, Shikaku was able to relay the formation to every member of the alliance at once.\\\\nThe first step would executed by the Kumo-nin, who would use Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar to temporarily blind the opponents and Storm Release: Laser Circus to create a cloud of dust. Next, Suna-nin would use their Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha\\'s vision, while Aburame clan members and Kiri-nin would use their Insect Jamming Technique and Hiding in Mist Technique to impair their sensory skills. \\\\nThe second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the Iwa-nin create a large sink hole with their Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core, with their lava users covering the beast with quicklime, mixing it with the Kiri-nin\\'s water. Konoha\\'s Sarutobi clan would then heat this mixture into concrete, trapping the Ten-Tails.\\\\nWith the Ten-Tails restrained, the rest of the alliance would rush Madara and Obito using taijutsu, having coordinated with Naruto to exploit their weaknesses.\"}\\n']\n"
