is an incredibly powerful technique and it is concidered to be the counterpart to to the technique known as Izanagi; as it rather than turning reality into illusion like the latter technique, allows for the user to turn illusion into reality. Izanami was first developed several decades ago by a sect of cultists who wished to breathe life into their desires, thoughts and dreams, to accomplish this, Izanami was developed trough three decades of great mental and physical labor; however when it was completed the results were mildly said, very disapointing; they found that any object created by Izanami gradually began to fade away into nothingness -- even worse went the experiments of using Izanami to create living minions, usually monstrous creatures meant to shield them from harm but also exotic women and beauties summoned for entertainment: Izanami though, was incapable of reproducing the emotions and inner norms that define right and wrong any any living creation created by the technique invariably went insane and proceeded to brutally kill their summoners; being naught but crazed beasts. Driven to desperation and panic, the cultists sealed the scroll and hid it in a cloister vault.
